      <div class="space-y-8 max-w-4xl mx-auto">
        <!-- Risk & Purchase -->
        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">What’s the risk in buying now?</h2>
          <p>You’ll have <strong>30 days after full launch</strong> to request a refund if SnapLayer isn’t right for you. That gives you plenty of time to test the product — there’s zero risk.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Why should I buy now instead of waiting for launch?</h2>
          <p>Early buyers lock in the <strong>biggest discounts</strong>, receive <strong>more starting credits and rollover</strong>, get <strong>higher referral bonuses</strong> and enjoy a 30‑day post‑launch refund window. You’re also helping fund focused development and gain voting power on the roadmap. If you’re unsure, you can wait until launch and pay the standard price.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Do unused credits roll over?</h2>
          <p>Normally credits reset each month. As an exclusive <strong>prelaunch perk</strong>, your unused credits will roll over up to <strong>5× your monthly limit</strong>. After launch this benefit may not be available.</p>
        </div>
        <!-- Licensing & Accounts -->
        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Can I sell or transfer my account?</h2>
          <p>Yes! Unlike most LTDs, SnapLayer lets you change your email and fully transfer or resell your license at any time. You may own multiple accounts.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Will I lose my LTD if I don’t use it often?</h2>
          <p>No. Your lifetime deal never expires. Monthly limits reset each month, and your account stays active even if you aren’t generating images for a while.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Can I upgrade later or stack plans?</h2>
          <p>Absolutely. You can purchase additional plans or upgrade anytime. Plans are stackable, so agencies can combine limits across multiple accounts.</p>
        </div>
        <!-- Trust & Founder -->
        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">How can I trust you and this product?</h2>
          <p>SnapLayer is part of the larger EmbrFyr system, which already serves paying clients. The founder has delivered several tech products (like a 3D origami app and the EmbrFyr platform) and is building SnapLayer in the open. You can see feedback from previous backers and the current prototype in our group. We’re committed to long‑term support.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Can you really build what you’re promising?</h2>
          <p>Yes. SnapLayer already has a working prototype that lets you create and download custom images. More features (SnapPages, SnapSheet, SnapLinks, PSD import, APIs) will roll out on schedule. The more early backers we have, the faster development progresses.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Will SnapLayer disappear like Nexweave?</h2>
          <p>No. SnapLayer isn’t a one‑off tool — it’s the image engine for EmbrFyr. Our infrastructure and long‑term plans ensure continued support. We even have an affiliate program if you want to partner.</p>
        </div>
        <!-- Product & Features -->
        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">What’s included in my LTD?</h2>
          <p>Each plan includes a set number of templates, limits on text and image fields per template, a monthly image quota with rollover for prelaunch buyers, and storage space. Higher tiers add SnapPages, PSD import, API access, subaccounts, white‑labeling and more. See the pricing table on the home page for details.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Can I use SnapLayer for client projects?</h2>
          <p>Yes. Your LTD comes with commercial rights. Use SnapLayer images in client work, marketing materials, websites or social posts. Higher tiers include subaccounts to separate client projects.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Will there be a public template gallery?</h2>
          <p>Yes! A shared gallery is coming post‑launch. You’ll be able to browse community templates and optionally share your own designs to earn perks.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">What makes SnapLayer different from other personalization tools?</h2>
          <p>SnapLayer combines simplicity, speed and affordability. It’s built on Cloudinary for performance, offers drag‑and‑drop editing with CSV bulk generation, includes referral tools and transparent pricing, and gives you full ownership of your templates. Unlike some competitors, we let you resell or transfer your LTD.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Will SnapLayer support video or GIF creation?</h2>
          <p>No. SnapLayer focuses exclusively on static images. Future video personalization may come as a separate product through EmbrFyr, and prelaunch buyers would get first access to any such offer. But SnapLayer itself will remain image‑focused.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Is there a hosted version or do I need to install anything?</h2>
          <p>SnapLayer is fully cloud‑based. There’s nothing to install. You simply log in through your browser to create and manage images.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Will SnapLayer integrate with other tools and automations?</h2>
          <p>Yes. Post‑launch we plan to introduce Google Sheets support, Zapier/Make/Pabbly connectors and a full REST API. Voting on the roadmap will help determine which integrations launch first.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Can I upload my own fonts or use custom branding?</h2>
          <p>Custom fonts and white‑labeling are supported on higher tiers. You can match your brand perfectly by uploading fonts and hiding SnapLayer’s logos.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">What image formats are supported?</h2>
          <p>You can download your images as PNG or JPG. Support for PDF and WebP exports will be added based on demand. Animated formats aren’t planned.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Is there a limit to how many images I can generate?</h2>
          <p>Each plan includes a generous monthly image quota that resets every month (with rollover for prelaunch buyers). There’s no lifetime cap, and you won’t be forced to buy extra credits.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Can I create templates with variables like {{name}}?</h2>
          <p>Yes. SnapLayer templates are built around variables. You can map text and image fields to CSV columns, query strings or API parameters to personalize content automatically.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Do I need to know Photoshop?</h2>
          <p>No. SnapLayer is designed for non‑designers. You can drag and drop elements in the editor or import flattened PSDs. For complex designs, our PSD import will extract text and image layers (effects must be flattened).</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Can I clone or remix templates?</h2>
          <p>Yes. You can duplicate any template you own or any public template and customize it to fit your needs. Remixing is encouraged.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">When will I get access to the dashboard and beta editor?</h2>
          <p>Prelaunch buyers will access the dashboard by early August 2025. It will include the beta editor and ways to earn bonus credits. Core features like SnapPages, SnapSheet and SnapLinks will be ready by launch day, with additional integrations rolling out based on votes.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Will I get early access to new features?</h2>
          <p>Yes. Prelaunch buyers get first access to new features as they’re completed. Your feedback helps refine them, and exceptionally helpful testers may receive bonus credits.</p>
